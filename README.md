### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* CountIf formula needed to include the criteria for Outcome. We could not simply filter in the Kickstarter datasheet to get appropriate numbers in Outcomes Based on Goals.
* Since there were no Cancelled plays in the dataset, a manual review of data in the Kickstarter datasheet was needed to validate if the CountIfs formula were working as expected.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
