# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise did not meet her fundraising target for her play Fever despite coming close to it. This analysis was conducted for Lousie to identify any trends in how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals to derive additional insights.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following graph shows the possible relation between successful, failed and canceled campaign outcomes (for other campaigns) compared to their respective launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The following graph shows the possible relation between successful, failed and canceled campaign outcomes (for other campaigns) compared to their pre-defined funding goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* CountIfs formula needed to include the criteria for Outcome. We could not simply filter in the Kickstarter datasheet to get appropriate numbers in Outcomes Based on Goals.
* Since there were no Cancelled plays in the dataset, a manual review of data in the Kickstarter datasheet was needed to validate if the CountIfs formula were working as expected.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1 Most successful trials were launched around May-June-July timeframe.
2 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
